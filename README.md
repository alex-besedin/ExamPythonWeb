# ExamPythonWeb
This is my exam project for SoftUni's Python Web Framework Course.
Creating a site for my keto fast food restaurant
KetoGo, showing the products we offer with their description
and comments from customers. "Like" option to add a product to 
customer's "favourites" list. "Product editor" and "Comment moderator"
permission groups available to grant the staff options to add, edit 
and delete products in the menu or edit and delete comments if they
have inappropriate or offensive content.
